* unix commands to know.  
  mostly things won't work as advertised if you're not in the right
  directory
  - 'ls' lists the contents of your current directory (folder)
  - 'cd' changes directories (or folders)
  - 'pwd' print working directory
  - 'cp' to copy files, 'mv' to move (rename) files
  - 'more', 'less', or 'cat' so see files from command line (shell)
  - 'pkg list-all | grep xyz' to look for package xyz on a chrome book

* general info
  - NOTE: terminal commands are enclosed in single quotes ('').
  - NOTE: the unix prompt will be denoted $ here.

  - I'm using Ubuntu as my OS (on a GNU/Linux system, try 'uname -a')
  - I have python 2.7.15rc1 ('python' or 'python2') and python 3.6.7
    ('python3')
  - 'sage' is built on top of python2, so anything you write in python
    will work in sage.
  - python can be interactive, but there's also 'ipython' ('ipython2'
    and 'ipython3')

* on programming
  - The examples I'll give you look really (almost stupidly) easy.
    They are intended to get you started for reading and writing more
    complicated programs.
  - Most of programming is knowing what can be done and finding the
    way to do it.
  - 'scratch' is a good language to start with, since it shows you the
    basic elements of programming in an intuitive layout.
  - The most important elements are variables, branches (if
    statements) and loops (for, while, do, etc.)

* first program: hello world
  - in a text editor of your choice, put in the following lines:
    print("Hello world!");
  - save the file as "hello.py"
  - many ways to run this program (sage is like ipython and #3 is not recommended)
    1. $ python hello.py
    2. $ ipython
       In [1]: %run hello
       In [2]: exit()
    3. $ python
       >>> exec(open('hello.py').read())
       >>> exit()

* second program: hello world, v2
  - example with variables
  - put this in a file, call it "hello2.py"
    greeting = "Hello";
    recipient = "world";
    punctuation = "!";
    print("%s %s%s"%(greeting, recipient, punctuation));
    
* third program: reading command line arguments
  - call this one "example_args.py"
    import sys;

    print(sys.argv); # prints all of the arguments on the cmd line
    if (len(sys.argv) > 1):
        print(sys.argv[1]); # prints the first optional argument

  - try running 'python example_args.py'
  - try running 'python example_args.py abc def hij'

* fourth program: hello, v3
  - call this one "hello3.py"
  - have this program return each argument on a separate line for an
    arbitrary number of arguments.
  - you figure out how to write it
  - if I call it with 'python hello3.py banana', it should output
    "Hello banana!"
  - if I call it with 'python hello3.py dog cat mouse', it should output
    "Hello dog!"
    "Hello cat!"
    "Hello mouse!"

* loops
  use a "for" loop to print out all the arguments in sys.argv, but NOT
  the file name of the program

  your will need something like this

  for kk in range(10):
    print(kk);

* writing to file
  fid = open('deleteme.txt','w');
  fid.write("hello world");
  fid.close();
* reading from a file
  fid = open('deleteme.txt','r');
  data1 = fid.read();
  fid.seek(0); # "rewinds" the file
  data2 = fid.read().replace(' ','') # removes spaces from the read-in text.
  fid.close();
* containers or iterables
** list
   mylist = [1,2,3,'dog','cat']
   mylist.append(5)
** tuple: I use these only as inputs for functions, I avoid them as variables, since they can't be chamged!
   mytuple = (1,2,3,'horse')
** dict
   mydictionary = {'the':1, 'and':1}
   mydictionary.update( {'for':1} )
   mydictionary['and'] += 1
