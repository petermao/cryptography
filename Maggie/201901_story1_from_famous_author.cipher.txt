many years ago  i contracted an intimacy with a mr  william
legrand  he was of an ancient huguenot family  and had once been
wealthy  but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want  to avoid
the mortification consequent upon his disasters  he left new orleans
the city of his fore fathers  and took up his residence at sullivan s
island  near charleston  south carolina
this island is a very singular one  it consists of little else than
the sea sand  and is about three miles long  its breadth at no point
exceeds a quarter of a mile  it is separated from the mainland by a
scarcely perceptible creek  oozing its way through a wilderness of
reeds and slime  a favorite resort of the marsh hen  the vegetation
as might be supposed  is scant  or at least dwarfish  no trees of any
magnitude are to be seen  near the western extremity  where fort
moultrie stands  and where are some miserable frame buildings
tenanted during summer by the fugitives from charleston dust and
fever  may be found  indeed  the bristly palmetto  but the whole
island  with the exception of this western point  and a line of hard
white beach on the seacoast  is covered with a dense undergrowth of
the sweet myrtle  so much prized by the horticulturists of
england  the shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty
feet  and forms an almost impenetrable coppice  burdening the air with
its fragrance
in the utmost recesses of this coppice  not far from the eastern or
more remote end of the island  legrand had built himself a small hut
which he occupied when i first  by mere accident  made his
acquaintance  this soon ripened into  friendship for there was much in
the recluse to excite interest and esteem  i found him well educated
with unusual powers of mind  but infected with misanthropy  and
subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy  he
had with him many books  but rarely employed them  his chief
amusements were gunning and fishing  or sauntering along the beach and
through the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological specimens  his
collection of the latter might have been envied by a swammerdamm  in
these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro  called
jupiter  who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family
but who could be induced  neither by threats nor by promises  to
abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps
of his young  massa will   it is not improbable that the relatives of
legrand  conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect  had
contrived to instil this obstinacy into jupiter  with a view to the
supervision and guardianship of the wanderer
the winters in the latitude of sullivan s island are seldom very
severe  and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a
fire is considered necessary  about the middle of october       there
occurred  however  a day of remarkable chilliness  just before sunset
i scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend
whom i had not visited for several weeks my residence being at that
time in charleston  a distance of nine miles from the island  while
the facilities of passage and re passage were very far behind those of
the present day  upon reaching the hut i rapped  as was my custom
and  getting no reply  sought for the key where i knew it was
secreted  unlocked the door and went in  a fine fire was blazing upon
the hearth  it was a novelty  and by no means an ungrateful one  i
threw off an overcoat  took an armchair by the crackling logs  and
awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts
soon after dark they arrived  and gave me a most cordial
welcome  jupiter  grinning from ear to ear  bustled about to prepare
some marsh hens for supper  legrand was in one of his fits how else
shall i term them  of enthusiasm  he had found an unknown bivalve
forming a new genus  and  more than this  he had hunted down and
secured  with jupiter s assistance  a scarab us which he believed to
be totally new  but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion
on the morrow
